## Getting Started

Download the code from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/menorashid/action_graphs.git
cd action_graphs
```

This repo requires Python 2.7. 

It'll be easiest to set up a virtual environment for this repo. 
```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python2.6 <path/to/action_graphs_venv>
```

Activate virtual env and install all needed requirements
```bash
source <path/to/action_graphs_venv>/bin/activate
cd <path/to/action_graph_git_repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
Download UCF101 features extracted from Kinetrics pretrained i3D [UCF101 Features](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9t770jhcjqo3mmg/release_data.zip) (5.5 GB)

Run the following commands
```bash
cd data
unzip <path to data zip file>
```

Thank you so much to Sujoy Paul for originally sharing these features [here] (https://github.com/sujoyp/wtalc-pytorch)

## Models
To download the pretrained models go [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/44ocinlmx8mp8v2/XX.zip) (XX MB)

Run the following commands
```bash
cd experiments
unzip <path to models zip file>
```
<!-- Otherwise add the individual models to *experiments/*
* [ActionGraphs on UCF101](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0e7tj2r708eue1/horse_full_model_tps.dat)(36 MB)
* [ActionGraphs on ActivityNet](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3vj7nts5f1v0ry0/horse_full_model_affine.dat)(63 MB)
* [ActionGraphs on Charades](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3un0dild6xar8uf/horse_tps_model.dat)(34 MB)

## Testing
To test pretrained model run the following line after commenting out the relevant code block
```bash
cd code
python test_pretrained.py
```

## Training
Script for training the full model with varying values of *d* as shown in Table 4 in the paper (comment out relevant lines in main):
```bash
cd code
python exps_deno.py
```
Script for training the models from Table 2 and Table 3 in the paper (comment out relevant lines in main):
```bash
cd code
python exps_ablation_etc.py
```
